# MsingiAI Data Challenge: Building Africa's Language Resources

The success of AI models like KANEX depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. Today, we're launching an ambitious initiative to create the largest open-source dataset of African languages, and we need your help.

## Why This Matters

African languages are severely underrepresented in current AI training datasets:

- Less than 2% of online content is in African languages
- Most African languages lack structured digital resources
- Existing datasets often contain errors or lack cultural context
- Critical applications like healthcare and education need local language support

## The Challenge

We're inviting contributors across Africa to help build this crucial resource:

### Phase 1: Text Collection (March - June 2025)

- Contribute written content in your local language
- Help digitize existing written materials
- Record and transcribe conversations
- Document idiomatic expressions and proverbs

### Phase 2: Validation (July - September 2025)

- Review and verify contributed content
- Add cultural context annotations
- Cross-reference with existing resources
- Quality check translations

### Phase 3: Structuring (October - December 2025)

- Organize content into structured formats
- Create parallel corpora
- Tag linguistic features
- Prepare for model training
