# Getting Started with Msingi AI Blog

Welcome to our new blog system! This post will show you how to create and publish blog posts on the Msingi AI website.

## How to Write a Post

Creating a new blog post is simple. Just follow these steps:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `posts` directory
2. Add the required frontmatter at the top of your file
3. Write your content using markdown syntax

### Required Frontmatter

Every post needs these fields at the top:

```
---
title: Your Post Title
date: YYYY-MM-DD
author: Your Name
excerpt: A brief description of your post
---
```

## Markdown Features

You can use all standard markdown features:

- **Bold text** using `**double asterisks**`
- *Italic text* using `*single asterisks*`
- [Links](https://example.com) using `[text](url)`
- Lists (like this one!)
- Code blocks (as shown above)

## Next Steps

Start writing your first post and add it to the `posts/index.json` file. Your post will automatically appear on the blog page!
